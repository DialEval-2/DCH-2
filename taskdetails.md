# NTCIR-16 Dialogue Evaluation Task (DialEval-2)

Recently, many reserachers are trying to build automatic helpdesk systems. However, there are very few methods to evaluate such systems. In **DialEval-2**, we aim to explore methods to evaluate task-oriented, multi-round, textual dialogue systems automatically. This dataset have the following features:

- Chinese customer-helpdesk dialogues carwled from [Weibo](weibo.com).
- English dialgoues: manually translated from the Chinese dialgoues.
- Nugget type annotatoins for each turn: indicate whether the current turn is useful to accomplish the task.
- Quality annotation for each dialogue.
  - task accomplishment
  - customer satisfaction
  - dialogue effectiveness

In DialEval-2, we consider annotations ground truth, and participants are required to predict nugget type for each turn (Nugget Detection, or ND) and dialogue quality for each dialogue (Dialogue Quality, or DQ).
