I have paid off the annual fee over 1,000 yuan in one time. Why do I still need to pay the phone bill? I dialed 123456789 and was told I didn't go to the business hall to cancel the original package. If it's not canceled, I need to pay over 70 yuan every month. Why didn't you cancel it when I changed the package? And you also didn't tell us it should be canceled?

The incident occurred in Fengxian Xidu Business Office of Shanghai Telecom. I supposed to bring along the equipment (note: the equipment was in good condition) and handle the refund of deposit for the equipment when the broadband expired. There was no notification of the business process, the equipment was returned normally and the business processing voucher was printed. Then an unexpected thing happened: the staff refused to refund the deposit, 200 yuan. Although the amount of money was small, may I ask why your company operates like this? Arrogant and domineering. I reserve the right to complain to the Consumer Protection Commission and bring a lawsuit. I hope you can give a reasonable reply as soon as possible. Show less d\n",
